\chapter{Sprint 1 - Summary}

In sprint 1, the main focus was planning and research, how the team is organized, requirements and test specifications. This sprint has mostly been centered around providing the right documentation to HSN, starting the project web page, as well as preparing the first oral presentation. The team had to establish a clear understanding of how to work in parallel to accomplish the build and integration of the quadcopters. 
\newline \newline
During the first sprint, the variable pitch mechanisms from Hobbyking's China division (Fig. \ref{fig:vpm}) was aquired.

The mechanisms was of poor quality, and the shaft on every mechanism was severely bent (Fig. \ref{fig:VPQHobbyking}) and could not be used. By comparing the picture from Hobbyking and the one acquired, the team concluded that the mechanisms were fake and not original parts. The team researched existing variable pitch mechanisms, but there are few commercially available. This made us consider the tail rotor mechanism of an Align T-rex helicopter. Most RC helicopter-tails have variable pitch, often with belt drive. If we want to have four separate motors with RPM control, the helicopter tail mechanisms needs to be modified.\bigskip

Additionally in sprint 1, the team got familiar with the motion capture system Qualisys at KIC. To understand the dynamics of a quadcopter, a simulation in Python was made. (Fig. \ref{fig:simulation})

Some of the challenges in sprint 1, were time estimation and time-logging. Estimates of time were often incorrect and the team had to make changes on how each sprint was planned.\bigskip

After presentation 1, the team got feedback that our motivation for the project was unclear. The team should also minimize the amount of documentation and be more selective of content. Consider making bigger documents instead of many separate. \bigskip


\section{Completion and Scope Change}

In sprint 1, all activities planned in the project plan were executed and 90 \% of all tasks were accomplished. Some technical tasks were postponed due to documentation and presentation 1. The remaining 10\% of the tasks were reevaluated and brought into sprint 2. There was 5\% scope change, which was due to tasks not identified in the planning phase, concerning documentation. The spike in the graph is due to a change in the way tasks and story points are rated and allocated in JIRA, and is not a real change in scope (Fig. \ref{fig:bds1}).

%\subsection{Results and Conclusion}
%Mechanisms did not work, motors was destroyed, could not start the design without the right hardware. Lite penger har utsatt bygging. 

%The biggest challenge encountered in Sprint 1 was that the variable pitch mechanisms ordered were of bad quality and the team therefore had to reevaluate how to achieve variable pitch.
