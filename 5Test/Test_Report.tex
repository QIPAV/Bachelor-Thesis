         {\shortstack[l]{GIVEN that we have a one motor test rig AND a microcontroller with a \\ working stabilizing code, WHEN we look at the test rig, THEN the \\motor  shall stay in the specified angle AND if we manually change angle; \\ the  motor shall adjust thrust accordingly.}}

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Purpose}}
The purpose of TR001 is to gain information of how a single motor with a fixed pitch propeller can be stabilized in one axis. To conduct this test, and fulfil AC008, a motor is mounted on an arm that can alter position in one axis. 

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Setup}}
In Tab. \ref{tab:tabt1} the equipment used conducting TR001 is displayed. 
\begin {table}[H]

    \caption {Test Equipment: One Motor Test Rig}

\end{table}


In Fig. \ref{fig:onemotor} an illustration of the test setup for the One Motor Test Rig is displayed. The DJI E800 motor is mounted on an arm that can alter position in one axis. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Test Setup: One Motor Test Rig}
    \label{fig:onemotor}
\end{figure}

On the arm the MPU5060 is mounted, and this sensor transmits position data to the Arduino Nano. The Arduino Nano will then transmit a PWM signal to the ESC that equals desired thrust to the motor based on the measured sensor value. The amount of thrust is determined by the current position relative to desired position. 
\\\\
In Appendix A1 the code used for the One Motor Test Rig is displayed. For this test we used the $PID\_v1.h$ library to control and stabilize the arm. Before conducting this test we determined the most appropriate PID parameters by trial and error. These parameters are displayed in Tab. \ref{tab:tabt2}.
\begin {table}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \caption {PID Parameters: One Motor Test Rig} 
    \label{tab:tabt2}

        Kd         & 1  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

In code the desired angle (Setpoint = desired angle;) was set before transferring code to the microcontroller. When a desired angle was given and the code was compiled and transferred; the motor provided the appropriate thrust and the the motor arm moved to the wanted position. 
\\\\
When the arm was manually moved in a positive or negative direction relative to the desired angle; the motor produced less or more thrust to compensate for the change in position.

When using libraries it is difficult to have an overview of how the code functions, unless the libraries are self composed. This may be a source of error.
\\\\
In this test, there were some measurement inaccuracy concerning the actual angle of the test arm and the angle input. This is due to the fact that there was no device measuring the actual angle of the arm. Also sensor instability was a reoccurring problem during the tests. Calibration and filtering of noise had to be implemented in order to achieve more stable results.

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Results}}
In this test the arm stayed in approximately the desired angle. In Tab. \ref{tab:tabt3} the results of the One Motor Test Rig is displayed.

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Purpose}}
The purpose of TR002 is to determine if the Arduino Nano can be used as an on-board chip for the quadcopter. 

\subsubsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Setup}}
In Tab. \ref{tab:tabt4} the equipment used conducting TR002 is displayed.

\end{table}

A flight controller normally has two loops; one for attitude control and one for rate control. Both these loops needs to be completed within 20ms. Having an unequipped on-board chip can put restrictions on the stabilization of the quadcopter. The test is conducted by running a loop and at the beginning of the loop a LED is set high, and at the end of the loop, low. To measure the computation time; an oscilloscope measuring probe was connected to the LED. 

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Assessment}}
At this point in the project the size of the code is assumed to be smaller than it will be in the future. 

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Results}}
In Tab. \ref{tab:tabt5} the time needed for the Arduino Nano to carry out its computations are displayed.  
\begin {table}[H]

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Purpose}}
The purpose of TR003 is to gain information of how to obtain stability, how to tune a controller and test sensors and their output. To do this, two motors with fixed pitch propellers are tested in 1-axis. To conduct this test, and fulfil AC014, one motor is mounted on each side of the testing rig which pivots around its center allowing movement in 1-axis. 

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Setup}}
In Fig. \ref{fig:testsetup3} an illustration of the test setup for the 1-axis test rig is displayed.

This test has been conducted in many iterations. It has been done with multiple sensors and multiple versions of code. On the test rig an IMU is mounted, and this sensor transmits position data to the Arduino Nano. The Arduino Nano will then transmit a PWM signal to the ESC that equals desired thrust to the motors based on the measured sensor values. The amount of thrust is determined by the current position relative to desired position. To stabilize the test rig a self-developed P-control has been implemented. \\
\\
In Appendix A2 the current code for TR003 can be found.\\
\\
All testing performed on the 1-axis test rig has been done to understand and document how the stabilization algorithms and sensors are performing. The 1-axis rig has been used continuously for testing stability, sensors and code for fixed pitch.

The quadcopter was very unstable. The reason might be noise on sensor and/or logic faults in the code. Another factor may be when the quadcopter hits the end of the line a reaction force is experienced by the quadcopter, telling the sensors that a dramatic change in position has occurred, hence making the quadcopter overcompensate and react unstably. 
\\\\
At this point it can be concluded that a combination of these factors are the reason for unstable flight.

The test rig gives a good indication of the actual thrust produced by the motor propeller combinations. The rig may have some measuring inaccuracies due to the small variations in mechanical mounting, the difference in width of the mounting plate in comparison to the real quadcopter arm, and the calibration of the weight.

In this test a servo was mounted to the Thrust Test Rig as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:VPM}. The servo adjusts the pitch angle on the variable pitch mechanism. In this test two potentiometers are used; one to adjust thrust and another to adjust the pitch angle. The potentiometer values are mapped to thrust values between 1000 and 2000 microseconds. The potentiometer used for the pitch angle adjustment is mapped to have a value between 0 and 180 degrees.\\

The test rig gives a good indication of the actual thrust produced by the motor propeller combinations. The rig may have some measuring inaccuracies due to the small variations in mechanical mounting, the difference in width of the mounting plate in comparison with a real quadcopter arm and the calibration of the weight.\\
\\
The servo value input for both the tests are not the same. The reason is that the test with the 3DR motor and Align mechanism needed a stronger servo motor. The servos were not mounted and configured in the same way.\\
\\
When a stronger servo was mounted to the 3DR motor and Align mechanism; it was still not strong enough to hold the pitch mechanism in place. This was probably due to poor mechanical power transfer.\\
\\
The test has only been performed for one specific thrust value and then running through the different settings of pitch. To get the whole picture of the relationship between thrust, pitch angle and efficiency the test must be performed for all possible combinations.

When position is reached the VPQ shall stay in desired position for 10 seconds before landing process is initiated.

\section{TR010: Simulated Variable Pitch Thrust Response}
\tr{T010}{AC021}{8}{BL022, BL050}{VPQ-385}
         {\shortstack[l]{GIVEN that we have a linearized motor propeller model AND the \\ system is implemented in Simulink, WHEN the simulation is ran, \\THEN the  systems thrust response shall be plotted in a graph.}}

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Purpose}}
The purpose of TR010 is to get an indication of the response time of pitch actuation versus increasing the motors rotational velocity.

% is to gain information regarding the response time when pitch is adjusted to achieve desired thrust versus increasing the thrust by increasing the voltage.

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Setup}}
This test is performed by implementing a matlab script with the derived and estimated values for the motor-propeller system. The matlab script is used along with a simulink block diagram. The structure of the block diagram i displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:blabla}. See XX for the full deduction of the motor-propeller model.\\

\end{figure}

For this experiment it is assumed a fixed rpm $(\omega_0)$ along with a fixed starting pitch  $(\alpha_0)$. 
$$\omega_0 = 730 rad/s$$
$$\alpha_0 = 2.5 angle$$
Then desired steps are applied to $\Delta v$ and $\Delta \alpha$.\\

In Appendix AX the matlab script used for TR010 can be found. In Appendix BX the simulink block diagram is displayed.\\

The motor propeller model used for this experiment is a simplified adaptation of the real physical model of the variable pitch motor and propeller. From this simplification the response might differ from reality, but can give an indication. 

\subsection*{\textsc{\medium Test Results}}
From Fig. \ref{fig:bla} the step response for a step in pitch versus a step in voltage can be seen. From Fig. \ref{fig:bla} it is observed that it takes a shorter amount of time to produce the desired thrust when pitch is actuated versus the time it takes to change the motors voltage.\\
\\
From Fig. \ref{fig:blablabla} the respective rotational velocities based on a step in $\Delta v$ and $\Delta \alpha$ are displayed.
